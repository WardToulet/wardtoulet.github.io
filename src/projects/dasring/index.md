Dasring is an experimental project I started of frustration with the state of information management inside my scouting group.

## Motivation
Currently member data can be found in these places:

- A google spreadsheet with all the member data
- An offline access database on the machine of the person responsible for enrollment, used to keep track of families
- The tool of the umbrella organization [scouts en gidsen Vlaanderen](https://groepsadmin.scoutsengidsenvlaanderen.be/groepsadmin/client/)
- Google groups with the members of each group used as email lists

Non of these tools can fulfill all of the requirements and so all of these are used and kept in sync **manually**

## Goals
Create a platform that bundles all the data listed above in one places.
